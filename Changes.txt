Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::MSSQLReporter.

1.03  Mon Jul 19 14:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Delete ./test.pl
	- Add examples/*.pl. These examples are updated versions of tutorials 12, 14 and 15:
		http://savage.net.au/Perl-tuts-1-30.html
	- Test examples/*.pl against MS SQL Server V 8.
		Warning: I could not get any of the MSDE examples to work with MS SQL Server V 8
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.02  Sun Mar 23 11:29:00 2003
	- No source code changes in this version
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.

1.01  Sun May 12 13:12:11 2002
	- Clean up licence and email stuff in all modules, scripts and other docs.
		Upgrading is not necessary
